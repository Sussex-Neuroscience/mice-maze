# Welcome to the Auditory part of the maze
## Hope you're here to stay!!



- The main logic of the experiment is in `main.py`. Feel free to modify it according to your needs. The code is designed to ask for user input but it is optimised to let you just hard code variables instead (it gets annoying to always input the same values for different mice, I get it. But if you work on more dynamic experiments, you have the option. All in all. The setup is designed to **give you options, nothing but options**.) 

- The trials generation is handled in `supfun_sequences.py`. 

- If you haven't calibrated your speaker yet, what are you waiting for? Head over to `speaker calibration scripts`. 
- If you don't need speaker calibration / have a better method (rude, but fine. At least share. How did you do it?), I recommend running `calibration_volume.py` to check which channel the sounds come out of.
