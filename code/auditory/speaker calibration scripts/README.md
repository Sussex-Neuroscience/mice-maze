This directory includes the scripts you need to calibrate your speaker, if it also has a non-flat frequency response. 

We tried 2 approaches: 
1. The approach that we ended up using is in the second half of notebook_calibration.ipynb. We retrieved the datapoints for the speaker frequency response using an online tool called WebPlotDigitizer (https://automeris.io/), and computed the gain to flatten the frequency response
2. The approach we tried and tested so you don't have to is: generate sounds by running calibration_freq.py and record them with an ultrasonic microphone and a digital sound meter, found a calibration constant to map FFT amplitude of the frequency to a volume in dB SPL. Ensure to change the sample rate of the output to the sample rate used by the sound card. Make sure to have a look at fft_volume and notebook_calibration.ipynb to modify according to your data/sound recording.
