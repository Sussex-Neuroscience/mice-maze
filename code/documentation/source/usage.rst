Usage
=====

The mice-maze project facilitates two primary experimental paradigms to study rodent exploration behavior: tactile and auditory experiments. These paradigms are implemented through specific hardware configurations and controlled via the software provided in the repository.

Experiment Setup
----------------
1. Place the maze in a low-light environment with IR illumination.
2. Load the software and verify the camera feed.
3. Configure stimuli and reward parameters.

Experimental Paradigms
----------------------

Tactile Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tactile experiments involve modifying the physical structure of the maze to present different textures or obstacles, allowing researchers to assess how tactile cues influence rodent navigation and decision-making.

Auditory Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Auditory experiments integrate sound stimuli to examine how auditory cues affect exploration and learning behaviors.
