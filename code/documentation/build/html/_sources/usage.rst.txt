Experimental Paradigms
----------------------

Tactile Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tactile experiments involve modifying the physical structure of the maze to present different textures or obstacles, allowing researchers to assess how tactile cues influence rodent navigation and decision-making.

Auditory Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Auditory experiments integrate sound stimuli to examine how auditory cues affect exploration and learning behaviors.
