active exploration setup for rodents

Figuring out initial bill of materials and acrylic dimensions:

- considerting the use of makerbeams (plates will slide in them), we need acrylic plates that are a bit longer than the area the mouse will have access to.

All side/wall plates will have the same dimensions and there will be a base plate and a ceiling plate.

on the base plate we will have regularly spaced threads, so that makerbeam posts can be fixed in. and different maze styles can be built.

- base plate: (paper dimensions - 12.7mm thickness 609.6 X 609.6 mm) for our system: 600 X 600 X 12 mm
- side plate: (paper dimensions - 40.63 X 50.8 X 3.175 mm) For our system: 50 X 50 X 3 mm 
- maker beams XL for support: 50mm length, black anodised aluminium.
- M3 bolts to fix the makerbeams on the plates
- m6 bolts as feet for the floor plate

We decided to go for an 4 arm maze initially to test things.

There are 8 end points in this. 

To build this, we need (with spares) 50 side panels and 50 makerbeam posts, celing and floor plates.
Also need M3 bolts
