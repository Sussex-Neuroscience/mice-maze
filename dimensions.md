***Converted/ extracted dimensions of Rosenberg Maze***

Whole maze dimensions Length: 609.6mm, Width: 609.6mm, Height (ie Floor to ceiling): 50.8mm

Ceiling thickness: 12.7mm
Acrylic wall thickness: 3.175mm

Corridor width: 28.575mm

In their design. From the top of the maze to the bottom there are 15 panels. 609.5/15=40.63

Therefore each panel width is 40.63mm

To the first junction (the first T) there are 7 panels. So the first corridor is 284.41mm.

Turning into the arms of the T there are 3 panels on each side, meaning an arm length of 121.89

***Measurements for our project maze***

Makerbeams: Height and width of 10mm. Variable length. They will be above and below the acrylic wall.

Acrylic wall height: 30.79mm  
Acrylic wall panel length: 40mm  
Acrylic wall panel thickness: Dependent on makerbeam T-slot.

Maker beams have optional lengths of 40mm premade, which is close to thee 40.63mm panels of the Rosenberg made, so we can alter the panel width to suit this.

To form a T-maze only, these are the number of parts needed.  
Number of panels needed: 29  
Number of (40mm) makerbeams needed: 58

***Final part measurements used during construction***

*A few measurements to be reconfirmed with tool*

Acrylic wall panels: H-50mm, L-50mm, W/Thicness - Xmm   

Screws: M3 16mm, with an M3 nut used on the underside of the maze baseplate.

Baseplate Thickness: 10mm (Smaller thicknesses of ~7.5mm up would also work.
Baseplate is 700mm by 700mm.

Makerbeams: [10 x 10 makerbeams](https://www.makerbeam.com/makerbeam/makerbeam-10x10mm-profile-lengths-anodised-in-blac/) were used with a custom length of 50mm.

We will use [these beams](https://www.metals4u.co.uk/materials/aluminium/aluminium-box-section/799-p?vat=inc&gcl[â€¦]yC8SSxSnme3ri-O_1YQuGo-yPlagg_-HQaAv4HEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) for the frame, with velcro on the maze baseplate and and on the beams for easy removal.
The beams fit together with plastic joints, and from the end of a joint to where the bar fits to the joint is 40mm.
We will 4 metal bars of 620mm each to go around the outside of the maze. And 4 bars of 760mm each to be the legs of the maze.
