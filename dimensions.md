***Converted/ extracted dimensions of Rosenberg Maze***

Whole maze dimensions Length: 609.6mm, Width: 609.6mm, Height (ie Floor to ceiling): 50.8mm

Ceiling thickness: 12.7mm
Acrylic wall thickness: 3.175mm

Corridor width: 28.575mm

In their design. From the top of the maze to the bottom there are 15 panels. 609.5/15=40.63

Therefore each panel width is 40.63mm

To the first junction (the first T) there are 7 panels. So the first corridor is 284.41mm.

Turning into the arms of the T there are 3 panels on each side, meaning an arm length of 121.89

***Measurements for our project maze***

Makerbeams: Height and width of 10mm. Variable length. They will be above and below the acrylic wall.

Acrylic wall height: 30.79mm  
Acrylic wall panel length: 40mm  
Acrylic wall panel thickness: Dependent on makerbeam T-slot.

Maker beams have optional lengths of 40mm premade, which is close to thee 40.63mm panels of the Rosenberg made, so we can alter the panel width to suit this.

To form a T-maze only, these are the number of parts needed.  
Number of panels needed: 29  
Number of (40mm) makerbeams needed: 58
